# Shield-option

## Project name
### Shield option

## Description
The Shield Option is a derivative product that pays variable coupons linked to the average credit rating of a whole industry. As the credit rating of the industry 
gets worse, the coupons of this derivative product increase. We use an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that has a modified doubly bounded Brownian motion along with
Euler discretization and Monte Carlo simulations to price such an option.
